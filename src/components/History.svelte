                With Version 1 released in November, 2016, Svelte
                has grown to become one of the most well-loved JS development frameworks.
                In 2021, Stack Overflow named Svelte as the 
                <a href= "https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021/?utm_source=social-share&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dev-survey-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> most loved development frameworks. </a>
                This beat out ASP.NET Core, React.js, Vue.js, and Angular.js. And while excitement,
                does not always mean easy to learn, enthusiasm in open-source languages
                means more updates and available components as Svelte continues to grow in popularity.

                Svelte's community is robust and supportive to new developers.
                A highlight when learning Svelte is the

                ,a Read-Eval-Print-Loop in the Svelte website to demonstrate both examples as simple as a Hello-World program
                to complex functionalities that can be built out with reactive Svelte Modules.

            Svelte's beauty is in how fast it is, with Richard Harris, the creator
            of Svelte,
            <a href= "https://svelte.dev/blog/frameworks-without-the-framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> claiming </a>
             Svelte is basically as fast as vanilla Javacript and faster than Vue and React,
             two of the more popular JS frameworks used in front end web development.

                What Marco, Ben, and I found most exciting about Svelte is how Svelte is not only new and fresh,
                but <strong>relevant</strong> Richard Harris' creation has been adopted by Facebook, Spotify, Apple, and 
                The New York Times. Learning this framework can be critical for anyone looking to
                break through  in the industry as a front-end web developer.
